package Taskwarrior::Kusarigama::Plugin::Command::Morning;
# ABSTRACT: run taskwarrior's garbage collection

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    $ task morning

=head1 DESCRIPTION

DEPRECATED: look at L<Taskwarrior::Kusarigama::Plugin::Morning>,
that does the same thing as this command, but automatically.

By default, taskwarrior runs its garbage
collection each time it's run. The problem is,
that garbage collection compact
(and thus changes) the task ids, so in-between
my last C<task list> and now, the ids might
be different. That's a pain. But if the garbage
collection is not run, hidden tasks and
recurring tasks won't be unhidden/created. That's a bigger pain.

My solution? Disable the garbage collecting,

    $ task config rc.gc off

but use this command once every morning.

This command, by the way, is only a glorified

    $ task rc.gc=on list limit:1
